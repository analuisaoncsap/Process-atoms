# Management of process atoms

This project is under development and has the purpose of managing process atoms. Process atoms are facts about a process that cannot be split into smaller parts. The management of process atoms provides a new way of doing conformance checking. 
Business users can have the power in their hands to be able to take informed decisions on how one activity influences the other, or how one activity influences the whole rest of the process. And they can do this by managing and modifying process atoms.

## Getting Started

- As input, the files 'output.csv' (constraints extracted from the BPMN) and 'diagram.json' (Json of the process image) are given.
- Atoms_constraint.py is analyzing the contraints and giving an ID for further management.
- Atoms_image.py is gettig the analysed constraint and making the necessary changes on the image.
